Fully client side Masari Web Wallet

# Disclaimer
The project was originally a proof of concept to allow a browser to connect directly on a cryptonight blockchain
It evolved into a new generation of Web Wallet for cryptonight coin, especially for Masari

# Project
This web wallet is doing everything on the client side, the server is currently only used to optimize
the communication with the daemon and compress the blockchain.  

This requirement may be removed in the future once daemons evolved and returns enough data 

# Security
**No keys, seed or sensitive data are sent to the server**  
If you find a potential security issue, please contact me so we/i can patch it as soon as possible  
Encryption is done with a certified library, [Tweetnacl.Js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js)

# Other coin/crypto
If you are a dev of a cryptonight/monero fork and would like to get a fork, please contact me.
Depending of you coin specificities, I can provide support, maintenance and development/updates for a payment in return, crypto only.
