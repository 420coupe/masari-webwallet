# Translating the web wallet 
You can help Masari by translation the wallet in your native language, it's really easy !

## Steps
- copy/paste the content of [the english translation](src/translations/en.json) in a text editor (notepad, word, ...)
- translate the parts between quotes that are always after ":"
For example, if you have that: 
```
"disableSecurity":"Disable this security, i understand the risk",
```
You need to translate 
```
Disable this security, i understand the risk
```
If you need to use double quotes (") in your text, please put a \ before it
- send us your translation by opening an issue on github or sending it to us directly on the [official discord](https://discord.gg/eSb9ZdM)
